# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-
The "Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning in Python" is an innovative healthcare project aimed at leveraging the power of machine learning to assist in the early diagnosis and prediction of multiple diseases. This system addresses the pressing need for efficient, accurate, and timely disease prediction, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare resources.
The project employs a variety of machine learning techniques, including classification algorithms, data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, to predict the likelihood of several common diseases based on general data. The system utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing a wide range of features such as gender, age, smoking history, drinking history, covid history, place of living etc.
